#TODO: Checking if a number is even or odd

#Algorithm

#! Use the "modulo" operator "%" which checks for the remainder after division

#*Use an if / else statement
#*Check if (number % 2) is equal to 0. If yes, print the number is even
#*Else print the number is odd

if (number % 2) == 0:
    print("This is an even number.")
else:
    print("This is an odd number.")
